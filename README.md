##oat boat CLI

The original backend around which I built the oat boat JavaFX application. 

I developed this as a CLI while unsure which GUI library to utilise -- development stopped once I transferred attention to the desktop app.
Thus, many classes in the desktop app will have their roots in the structure and naming conventions laid down here.
